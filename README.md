## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Required to install:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

1. **Clone this repo to your local machine using:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ita-social-projects/dokazovi-fe
```

2. **Start the app with IDE:**

Enter the project folder and write in terminal:

```shell
npm install
```

Install all required modules/dependencies

```shell
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See more - [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

## Deployment

```shell
npm build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
